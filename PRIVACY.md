# Privacy Policy for ImageShare

ImageShare is committed to respecting your privacy and being transparent about the collected data. This policy outlines what information is transmitted during the installation and use of ImageShare's main server, how it is used, and how you can control the collection.

**This privacy policy only applies to the main ImageShare server at [theimageshare.com](https://theimageshare.com).** Third-party ImageShare servers may handle user data in different ways.

## Information collected by ImageShare

When you upload a file to ImageShare, it is processed by the server and hosted as a public download for a period of time displayed on the upload result page. The files are hosted on ImageShare's own servers and are not transmitted to a third-party service. When the displayed time runs out, the file is permanently deleted from the server.

When you upload a file to Imgur, it is processed by the server, and uploaded to imgur. Once it is uploaded, the server deletes the cached file and shows you the link to the imgur upload. When sending the image to Imgur, we do not send any informartion alongside it, keeping the uploads anomonus. Do note that all uploads to imgur are public and can be seen by anyone else with that link! We do not keep the file uploaded on our server after it has been uploaded, only imgur has the upload. For more information on Imgur's privacy policy, refer to: [https://imgur.com/privacy](https://imgur.com/privacy)

ImageShare also uses the privacy-friendly Plausible Analytics, which is subject to the [Plausible Analytics Privacy Policy](https://plausible.io/privacy). ImageShare transmits the following information over an encrypted HTTPS connection:

- **Platform information:** Your operating system and type of device.
- **Browser information:** Your browser name, version, and other related data.
- **IP address**: This is used to identify your country and region.
- **User action**: If you are uploading an image or not.
  - **Upload Type**: The method the user choses to upload

This data is deleted from the server after the page load or image upload is complete, and the data stored in Plausible Analytics is anonymized to hide your IP address and other sensitive information. The analytics data is always transmitted from the server to Plausible over a secure HTTPS (SSL) connection, even if your device's connection to the server is over an insecure HTTP connection.

## Insecure data transmission with ImageShare

ImageShare supports unencrypted connections over HTTP for compatibility with legacy devices and browsers, in addition to modern encrypted HTTPS connections. If you are using ImageShare over an unencrypted connection, any data transmitted through ImageShare can be intercepted and modified by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), router, or other intermediary party.

You should only use ImageShare over an unencrypted HTTP connection if you are using a trusted network. 

## How ImageShare uses your information

The analytics data collected by the main ImageShare server is used for ImageShare development. It can help identify problems with certain platforms, determine which browsers and devices are most frequently used, and so on.

The analytics data is stored in Plausible Analytics and is not shared or sold.
